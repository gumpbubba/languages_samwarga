My progress so far:

Bought a kinect
Learned how to take 3d scans using Skanect
Scanned my head
Implemeted model into appropriate obj format for processing
Began new sketch, imported relevant libraries 
Set up a basic interaction, press 'A' head appears, move mouse around and it follows

To do:
Figure out face detection
Implement face detection into sketch
map face coordinates 
Figure out how to have 3d model "follow" face detection input
